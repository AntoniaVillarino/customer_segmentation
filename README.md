This dataset is one of the dataset that comes with Tableau Desktop, and it contains information about orders and customers of a online Superstore. I've downloaded a version here: [https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data](https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data).

My goals:

- Define a new segmentation for the customers using [RFM analysis](https://www.eightleaves.com/2011/01/using-rfm-to-identify-your-best-customers/), because I find that the 3 Segments that are defined in the dataset are not very descriptive.
- Predict sales of specific product categories
- See the geospatial distribution of customers, sales, categories, shipping cost...
